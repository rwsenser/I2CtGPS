I2CtGPS -- I2C access to simple, serial GPS devices.

See I2CtGPS.pdf for usage information and details.  It contains the main "readme" information.

Note:
Unless you are using UNO Arduino hardware as your I2C client, please reanme the file GPStester/GPStesterUNO.ino
to something like GPStester.hideino.   If this file is not renamed, the ARDUINO IDE will "object" to
processing this extra file.  If you are using an UNO, please create an ARDUINO directory for GPStesterUNO and move
GPStesterUNO.ino to this new directory.

This interface has been sucessfully tested with several hobby-grade GPS boards and serveral I2C clients.
